# VolleyAPI


•	Automatic scheduling of network requests.
•	It is developed by google.
•	Multiple concurrent network connections.
•	Transparent disk and memory response caching with standard HTTP cache coherence.
•	Support for request prioritization.
•	Cancellation request API. You can cancel a single request, or you can set blocks or scopes of requests to cancel.
•	Ease of customization, for example, for retry and back off.
•	Strong ordering that makes it easy to correctly populate your UI with data fetched asynchronously from the network.
•	Debugging and tracing tools.

Volley is not suitable for large download or streaming operations since Volley holds all responses in memory during parsing .
