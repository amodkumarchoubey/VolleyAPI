# VolleyAPI


•	Automatic scheduling of network requests.




•	It is developed by google.





•	Multiple concurrent network connections.


•	Transparent disk and memory response caching with standard HTTP cache coherence.





•	Support for request prioritization.



•	Cancellation request API. You can cancel a single request, or you can set blocks or scopes of requests to cancel.


•	Ease of customization, for example, for retry and back off.


•	Strong ordering that makes it easy to correctly populate your UI with data fetched asynchronously from the network.


•	Debugging and tracing tools.

Volley is not suitable for large download or streaming operations since Volley holds all responses in memory during parsing .
